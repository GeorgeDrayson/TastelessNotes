# Tasteless Notes

A note taking SPA (single-page app) developed by **The Tasteless Sheep**: Viv (@VivianAllen), Julian (@julesnuggy), George (@GeorgeDrayson) and Chris (@defc0nONE).

## Objectives:
 - Develop an application using only pure JavaScript (with the exception of the npm package **http-server** package to serve the app) where a user can:
    - Add a note
    - See a list of notes already added (cut down to the first 20 characters of each note)
    - Viewing the entire body of a note
- Build our own testing framework to be able to utilize feature and unit tests needed, allowing us to employ TDD to drive the development of our application
